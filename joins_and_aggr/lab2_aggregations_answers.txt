1. What's the difference between inner join and left outer join?
Answer: the inner join keeps only records where the key exists in both datasets and the left outer join keeps all records from the left dataset, and adds matching records from the right; if no match exists, the right side becomes NULL.

3. What does RFM stand for and why is it useful?
