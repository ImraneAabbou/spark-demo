1. What does the map() transformation return?
Answer: it returns A new RDD with the same number of elements, each element transformed by the provided function.

2. When should you use mapPartitions() instead of map()?
Answer: map will execute the given function on each row on the RDD while the mapPartitions executes it on partition of rows

3. Can map() change the number of elements in the RDD?
Answer: it cannot as we saw in it's definition the RDD's length stays the same.
  x = [x_1, x_2, x_3, ...]
  x.map(f) = [f(x_1), f(x_2), f(x_3), ...]
